## Gold recovery
***Machine Learning, sMAPE, KDE***

### Brief description of the project
We have data with mining and refining parameters at our disposal.
The goal is to build a model to predict the recovery rate of gold from gold-bearing ore.  

### Used libraries
*pandas*, *numpy*, *matplotlib*, *sklearn.(pipline, tree, ensemble, metrics, linear_model, impute, preprocessing, model_selection)*, *tqdm*

### Description of work performed
Opened data, tested ore enrichment efficiency. Test and training samples are checked for completeness.  
Exploratory data analysis performed.  
Three models trained and tested.
