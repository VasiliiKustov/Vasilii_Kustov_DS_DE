## Borehole Location Selection
***Machine Learning in Business***.

### Brief description of the project
We were given oil samples in three regions: each of 10,000 fields where the quality of oil and the volume of its reserves were measured. 
Objective:   
- To build a machine learning model to help determine the region where production will yield the highest profits.  
- Analyze the possible profits and risks using the *Bootstrap* technique.

### libraries used
*pandas*, *numpy*, *sklearn.(model_selection, linear_model, metrics)*

### Description of the work done
Regression task.
The linear regression models are trained.  
Determined the region where mining will bring the maximum possible profit.  
With the help of `bootstrap` technique calculated profits and risks.
