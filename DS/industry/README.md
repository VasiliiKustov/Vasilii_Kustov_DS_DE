## Industry
### Graduation Project**.

### Brief description of the project
A model that predicts the temperature of steel is required to possibly reduce electricity consumption.

### libraries used
*pandas*, *os*, *numpy*, *matplotlib*,*sklearn.(stats, compose, preprocessing, model_selection, metrics, linear_model, tree)*, *tqdm*, *catboost*

### Description of work done
Performed data preprocessing - work with gaps, duplicates and data types. Calculated the necessary sums of values to create the features.  
exploratory data analysis performed. Selected the significant attributes from the dataset. Models were trained and tested. Achieved the necessary magnitude of the `MAE`.
